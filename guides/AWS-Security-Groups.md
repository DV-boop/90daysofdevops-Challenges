# AWS Security Groups Guide  

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up and configuring Security Groups in AWS, which are essential for managing inbound and outbound traffic to your instances.

---

## **What is an AWS Security Group?**  
- A Security Group acts as a virtual firewall for your Amazon EC2 instances.  
- It controls both inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level.  
- By defining rules, you can permit or block specific types of traffic, such as SSH, HTTP, or HTTPS.

---

## **Step 1: Launch an EC2 Instance**  

1. Go to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and navigate to **EC2 Dashboard**.  
2. Click **Launch Instance** and provide the required instance details:
   - Select an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) (e.g., Ubuntu, Amazon Linux).  
   - Choose an instance type (e.g., t2.micro for free tier).  
   - Configure key pair settings if needed.

## **Step 2: Create a New Security Group**  

1. On the **Configure Security Group** page:  
   - Select **Create a new security group**.  
   - Give your security group a descriptive name (e.g., `my-ec2-security-group`).  
   - Add rules to allow specific traffic:

### **Common Rules to Add:**  
| Type        | Protocol | Port Range | Source           |
|-------------|----------|------------|------------------|
| SSH         | TCP      | 22         | Your IP address  |
| HTTP        | TCP      | 80         | Anywhere (0.0.0.0/0) |
| HTTPS       | TCP      | 443        | Anywhere (0.0.0.0/0) |

2. Click **Review and Launch**, then **Launch** your instance.

## **Step 3: Modify Security Group Rules (Optional)**  

1. Go to the EC2 Dashboard and select **Security Groups** under **Network & Security**.  
2. Select your security group and click **Edit inbound rules**.  
3. Add or remove rules as per your requirements.

---

## **Step 4: Test Connectivity**  

- **SSH:**  
  Connect to the instance using your terminal:  
  ```bash
  ssh -i "your-key.pem" ec2-user@<EC2-Public-IP>

##  **HTTP/HTTPS:**
    Visit http://<EC2-Public-IP> in your browser if a web server is running.

##  **Security Best Practices**
1. Restrict SSH Access: Only allow specific IPs instead of 0.0.0.0/0.
2. Use HTTPS: Always enable secure connections where possible.
3. Review Rules Regularly: Periodically audit and optimize your security rules.
